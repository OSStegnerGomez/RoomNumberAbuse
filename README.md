# RoomNumberAbuse
This pile of Node-Javascript-Code is a pattern miner of sequence numbers based on the Room Nos. in the 3 story building of PJS,Mz.-Gonsenheim.  It should be trying to find as many occurences of the same 6-digit number inside the given number as possible, but the 3 digits either on the -> or the &lt;- (or both) of the 6-digit number must be diffrent.
